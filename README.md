# Note Taker

  ## Description

  This project was created because I wanted to create a place to take down and delete notes that can be accessed anywhere.
  What this does is it uses express routes to post and delete from a json file to update content.
  What I learned from project was how to create routes to post and delete from a file and how to assign ids to the content in the json file so it can be deleted.

  ## Usage

  When you open the page there will be a get started button to click. It will take you to a page where you can input notes. In the text box where it says 'Note Title' you can enter a title for the note. In the note text box you can fill out the note contents. Once you have typed something into both of them a save button will pop up on the top right to save contents. Once saved the note will show up on the left along with any previous notes. You can click on the notes to view the contents. You can also hit the red trash can to delete the note.
